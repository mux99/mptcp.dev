## Enabeling on linux systems
run the following command:
```bash
sysctl net.mptcp.enabled=1
```

## Force MPTCP
apps can be forces to use one of the following methods

- [mptcpize](https://www.mankier.com/8/mptcpize)

    `mptcpize run <app command>`  
    this works by modifying the behaviour of the underlaying lib-c  
    *note: this does does not always work and should not be used for production*

- [GODEBUG](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/507375)

    whith GO, the lib-c is not used, so `mptcpize` will not work.
    to force MPTCP the environment variable `GODEBUG=multipathtcp=1` can be used.

- [eBPF](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/commit/?id=ddba122428a7)

- [systemtap](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/getting-started-with-multipath-tcp_configuring-and-managing-networking#preparing-rhel-to-enable-mptcp-support_getting-started-with-multipath-tcp)

## ss commands
the `ss` command on linux systems has an option to list MPTCP socket `-M`. the recommanded call is `ss -Menita`

- `M`, MPTCP sockets
- `t`, TCP including subflows created by MPTCP
- `n`, prevent the port number to protocol vonversion
- `i`, info on the connection TCP_INFO, MPTCP_INFO, etc.
- `e`, more info
- `a`, dysplay all socket not just "established" ones

## Making use of multiple streams
For the apps to be able to use multiple streams the kernel needs to be told what interfaces can be used to do so.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Manual configuration</summary>

With multiple addresses defined on several interfaces, you want to be able to tell your kernel "If I select such source address, please use that specific interface+gateway, not the default ones". You achieve this by configuring one routing table per outgoing interface, each routing table being identified by a number. The route selection process then happens in two phases. First the kernel does a lookup in the policy table (that you need to configure with ip rules). The policies, in our case, will be For such source prefix, go to routing table number x. Then the corresponding routing table is examined to select the gateway based on the destination address.

You need to configure several routing tables in the following manner: Imagine you have two interfaces eth0 and eth1 with the following properties:

```bash
eth0

  IP-Address: 10.1.1.2
  Subnet-Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Gateway: 10.1.1.1

eth1

  IP-Address: 10.1.2.2
  Subnet-Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Gateway: 10.1.2.1
```

Thus, you need to configure the routing rules so that packets with source-IP 10.1.1.2 will get routed over eth0 and those with 10.1.2.2 will get routed over eth1.

The necessary commands are:

```bash
# This creates two different routing tables, that we use based on the source-address.
ip rule add from 10.1.1.2 table 1
ip rule add from 10.1.2.2 table 2

# Configure the two different routing tables
ip route add 10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0 scope link table 1
ip route add default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0 table 1

ip route add 10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1 scope link table 2
ip route add default via 10.1.2.1 dev eth1 table 2

# default route for the selection process of normal internet-traffic
ip route add default scope global nexthop via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0
```
With this, your routing table should look like the following:

```bash
mptcp-kernel:~# ip rule show
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from 10.1.2.2 lookup 2
32765:  from 10.1.1.2 lookup 1
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route
10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.1.2
10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.2.2
default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route show table 1
10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route show table 2
10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1  scope link
default via 10.1.2.1 dev eth1
```

<summary>Automatic Configuration</summary>

Doing the above each time by hand is very cumbersome. Some alternative automatic solutions are available:

### Using the configuration scripts (Ubuntu/Debian-based systems)

In /etc/network/if-up.d/ you can place scripts that will be executed each time a new interface comes up. We created two scripts:

```bash
* mptcp_up - Place it inside /etc/network/if-up.d/ and make it executable.
* mptcp_down - Place it inside /etc/network/if-post-down.d/ and make it executable.
```

These scripts work most of the time. They use environment variables to configure the routing tables. If they do not work for you, please contact us on the [mptcp-dev](https://listes-2.sipr.ucl.ac.be/sympa/info/mptcp-dev) Mailing-List.

### Automatic configuration with "Multihomed-Routing"

Kristian Evensen <kristian.evensen@gmail.com> developed a set of scripts that integrate well with existing Network Managers to properly configure the multihomed routing. Check it out at [https://github.com/kristrev/multihomed-routing].

### Automatic configuration with ConnMan

Dragos Tatulea <dragos@endocode.com> and Dongsu Park <dongsu@endocode> integrated support for Multipath TCP into ConnMan. Checkout his [github repository](https://github.com/endocode/connman) for access to the source-code

### Another way for Gentoo-based systems

Ond≈ôej Caletka <Ondrej.Caletka@cesnet.cz> created a script for his Gentoo-based system. You can use his script from [github](https://gist.github.com/oskar456/7264828). For any questions, please contact him directly.

### DEPRECATED - Automatic configuration with MULTI

Kristian Evensen <kristrev@simula.no> created a daemon which automatically configures the correct routing tables. You can install his tool from [github](https://github.com/kristrev/multi).
