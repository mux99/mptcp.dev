## Enabling on linux systems
run the following command:
```bash
sysctl net.mptcp.enabled=1
```

## Force MPTCP
Apps can be forces to use one of the following methods

- [mptcpize](https://www.mankier.com/8/mptcpize)

    `mptcpize run <app command>`  
    This works by modifying the behavior of the underlying lib-c

    {: .note}
    Some admins do not like this technique, that is why it is recommended to update
    apps to support MPTCP natively.

- [GODEBUG](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/507375)

    With GO, the lib-c is not used, so `mptcpize` will not work.
    To force MPTCP the environment variable `GODEBUG=multipathtcp=1` can be used.

- [eBPF](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/commit/?id=ddba122428a7)

- [systemtap](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/getting-started-with-multipath-tcp_configuring-and-managing-networking#preparing-rhel-to-enable-mptcp-support_getting-started-with-multipath-tcp)

## ss commands
The `ss` command on linux systems has an option to list MPTCP sockets `-M`. The
recommended call is `ss -Mani`. To see subflows (if executed as root) `ss -tani`
can be used, subflows are marked as `tcp-ulp-mptcp`.

- `M`, MPTCP sockets
- `t`, TCP including subflows created by MPTCP
- `n`, prevent the port number to protocol conversion
- `i`, info on the connection TCP_INFO, MPTCP_INFO, etc.
- `e`, more info
- `a`, display all socket not just "established" ones

## Making Use of Multiple Streams

To enable applications to leverage multiple streams, it's essential to inform the kernel about which network interfaces are available for this purpose. This process involves two main steps: setting up MPTCP endpoints and configuring the routing. Both steps are crucial for the optimal functioning of MPTCP.

### Setting MPTCP Endpoints

#### Why?

MPTCP works by distributing TCP connections across multiple paths, which necessitates the establishment of multiple endpoints. Specifying MPTCP endpoints allows the system to understand which IP addresses can be used to initiate these multiple paths. It's a foundational step to ensure that the MPTCP protocol can efficiently manage traffic across different network interfaces.

#### How?

To set MPTCP endpoints, you use the `ip mptcp` command. Here's a basic example:

```bash
ip mptcp endpoint add 192.168.1.1 signal
ip mptcp endpoint add 192.168.2.1 subflow
```

### Configuring Routing
#### Why?
After setting up the endpoints, it's necessary to configure the routing. This step ensures that the data packets know which path to take when leaving the system. Without proper routing, even if multiple paths are available, the system might not utilize them effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.

#### How?
Routing involves using ip route and ip rule commands to direct traffic based on the source IP addresses or other criteria. Hereâ€™s a simplified example:

```bash
# Add IP routes for each interface
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 table 100
ip route add default via 192.168.2.1 dev eth1 table 200

# Set rules to select route table based on source IP
ip rule add from 192.168.1.0/24 table 100
ip rule add from 192.168.2.0/24 table 200
```

These commands configure the system to use different routes for traffic originating from different source IP addresses, allowing MPTCP to efficiently manage multiple paths.

By carefully setting MPTCP endpoints and configuring routing, you can fully exploit the advantages of MPTCP, enhancing the resilience and performance of network connections.

## Making use of multiple subflows
For the apps to be able to use multiple streams the kernel needs to be told what
interfaces can be used to do so.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Manual configuration</summary>

With multiple addresses defined on several interfaces, you want to be able to tell
your kernel "If I select such source address, please use that specific interface+gateway,
not the default ones". You achieve this by configuring one routing table per outgoing
interface, each routing table being identified by a number. The route selection
process then happens in two phases. First the kernel does a lookup in the policy
table (that you need to configure with ip rules). The policies, in our case, will
be For such source prefix, go to routing table number x. Then the corresponding
routing table is examined to select the gateway based on the destination address.

You need to configure several routing tables in the following manner: Imagine you
have two interfaces eth0 and eth1 with the following properties:

```bash
eth0

  IP-Address: 10.1.1.2
  Subnet-Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Gateway: 10.1.1.1

eth1

  IP-Address: 10.1.2.2
  Subnet-Mask: 255.255.255.0
  Gateway: 10.1.2.1
```

Thus, you need to configure the routing rules so that packets with source-IP 10.1.1.2
will get routed over eth0 and those with 10.1.2.2 will get routed over eth1.

The necessary commands are:

```bash
# This creates two different routing tables, that we use based on the source-address.
ip rule add from 10.1.1.2 table 1
ip rule add from 10.1.2.2 table 2

# Configure the two different routing tables
ip route add 10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0 scope link table 1
ip route add default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0 table 1

ip route add 10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1 scope link table 2
ip route add default via 10.1.2.1 dev eth1 table 2

# default route for the selection process of normal internet-traffic
ip route add default scope global nexthop via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0
```
With this, your routing table should look like the following:

```bash
mptcp-kernel:~# ip rule show
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from 10.1.2.2 lookup 2
32765:  from 10.1.1.2 lookup 1
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route
10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.1.2
10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.2.2
default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route show table 1
10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
default via 10.1.1.1 dev eth0

mptcp-kernel:~# ip route show table 2
10.1.2.0/24 dev eth1  scope link
default via 10.1.2.1 dev eth1
```
